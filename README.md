# Seven Languages in Seven Weeks

This is my practice repo for the book [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](https://pragprog.com/titles/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/) by Bruce A. Tate.

I'm reading this book as part of the [README](https://www.readme.gg) bookclub by [TJ DeVries](https://github.com/tjdevries), [bashbunni](https://github.com/bashbunni), and [David Begin](https://github.com/davidbegin)
